# Chapter 10: Vim Scripts and Plugin Management

Welcome back Vim enthusiasts! You've already learned how to speed up your workflow with Vim mappings and macros, but now it's time to take your Vim skills to the next level by diving into Vim scripts and plugin management.

As you continue to use Vim on a daily basis, you'll quickly find that there are plenty of areas where Vim could improve. Fortunately, Vim is a highly customizable editor, and you can tweak it to your heart's content by writing Vim scripts. In this chapter, we'll teach you how to write your own Vim scripts so you can mold this editor to fit your personal preferences.

But why stop there? Chances are that many others have already done what you're hoping to achieve with Vim, and we've got good news for you - there is a large community out there who share their Vim scripts, plugins and knowledge on how to make the most out of this fantastic editor.

We couldn't talk about Vim plugins without mentioning [Tim Pope](https://tpo.pe/), one of the most significant contributors to the Vim ecosystem. He has written some of the most popular plugins, such as [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible) and [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive), both used by thousands of Vim users worldwide.

In this chapter, we aim to give you a solid understanding of Vim script syntax and structure, and explore different ways to manage your Vim plugins. We will cover the following topics:

- Vimscript syntax and structure
- Using variables and functions in Vim scripts
- Script communication and variables scope
- Configuring Vim plugins using Vundle, Pathogen, and Vim-Plug.

We know you're eager to get started, so let's jump right in and start writing some Vimscript!
# Chapter 10 Exercises

Congratulations on making it to the end of Chapter 10! This chapter has covered a lot of ground, and we hope you enjoyed learning about Vim scripts and plugin management.

To reinforce what you've learned, here are some exercises for you to try:

## Exercise 1: Write a Vim plugin

Try writing a simple Vim plugin that toggles the spell check on and off using a key mapping. You can use either Vimscript or your language of choice that supports Vimscript.

## Exercise 2: Build your Vim configuration with Vundle

Install and configure Vundle to manage your Vim plugins. Choose a few plugins to install and configure them in your `.vimrc` file. Don't forget to document what each plugin does and why you chose it.

## Exercise 3: Explore Vim plugins by Tim Pope

Take a look at some of the Vim plugins created by Tim Pope. Try installing some of them using your plugin manager of choice and test them out. What's your favourite Tim Pope plugin, and why?

We hope that these exercises help you to solidify your understanding of Vim scripts and plugin management. As always, if you get stuck or have any questions, don't hesitate to ask for help from the Vim community or your peers.

And don't forget to follow [Tim Pope](https://tpo.pe/) on Github and Twitter for more Vim tips and tricks!
When resolving plugin dependencies, it's vital to have a plugin manager that resolves and installs the right version of the required plugin. Vim-Plug is an excellent example of an efficient plugin manager.

The `Vim-Plug` plugin manager uses a `vimrc` configuration file to manage your Vim configurations and plugins in a robust and efficient way. In particular, the configuration file includes the following key sections:

1. Plugin installation definition
  - This section contains a list of plugins that you want to install and the github repository URLs for each plugin.
 
2. Plugin configuration definition
  - This section gets executed when the plugin is installed, and it sets up any configurations required for the installed plugin.
  - This section can also set up the mappings and commands required for the plugin and configure its settings.

The `Plug` function is the heart of Vim-Plugâ€™s configuration file. It is responsible for managing plugin installation and configuration. The basic format for adding a plugin is:

```
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

Plug '<GitHub repo URL>'

call plug#end()
```
`Plug` is the function used to add a plugin to your Vim configuration, and it takes one argument: the github repository URL for the plugin. By default, Vim-Plug installs the master branch of the plugin.

You can also specify the branch or the Git tag you want to install as follows:
```
Plug '<GitHub repo URL>', { 'branch': '<branch-name>' }

Plug '<GitHub repo URL>', { 'tag': '<version-tag>' }
```

Once the installation has completed, you can add configuration settings for your plugin by wrapping the configuration dictionary in a `with` statement. For example:
```
Plug '<GitHub repo URL>'

" Some additional configuration
with plugin_name.config() | Plug '<GitHub repo URL>' | endwith
```
The `with` block can chain multiple configurations and provides a clear and concise way to configure a plugin with Vim-Plug.

Overall, Vim-Plug is an excellent plugin manager that makes plugin management easy and efficient. Investing time in learning how to use it is well worth it in the long run.
