# Chapter 11: Advanced Visual Modes and Selections in Vim

Welcome to the eleventh chapter of our guide to Advanced Vim! In the previous chapter, we discussed Vim Scripts and Plugin Management, which are essential tools to customize your Vim editor.

In this chapter, we will cover the Advanced Visual Modes and Selections in Vim. This is an exciting chapter as it will teach you how to make precise and efficient selections of text, lines, blocks, and more, using Vim's powerful visual modes. These selection capabilities are essential for text manipulation and editing work.

We will start by discussing the basics of visual modes and then move on to the advanced visual modes in Vim. You will learn about the various visual modes, how to select and deselect text, how to use selection operators, and much more.

We will also discuss visual block mode, which is an extremely powerful mode for manipulating text in columns. We will cover how to select columns, insert text at specific column locations, and how to delete, yank, and paste columns of text.

Throughout the chapter, we will incorporate relevant examples and code snippets to ensure that you have a comprehensive understanding of the topic. We will also refer to published journals and articles to enrich your learning experience.

By the end of this chapter, you will have gained an in-depth knowledge of the advanced visual modes and selections in Vim. You will be able to use these advanced techniques to work faster, more efficiently, and with greater precision. So, let's dive in and get started with the awe-inspiring features of the vi editor!
# Advanced Visual Modes and Selections in Vim

When it comes to text editing, selecting the right part of text is often half the battle. In Vim, you can make precise and efficient text selections using the powerful visual modes available. In this chapter, we will discuss the advanced visual modes and selections in Vim, allowing you to manipulate text in ways you never thought possible.

We will provide you with essential concepts and techniques for utilizing the visual modes and blocks to make your text selection more efficient with fewer keystrokes. From selection operators to column selection and how to insert text at specific column locations, you will learn how to work with text like a pro!

We will also discuss some tricks and uncommon functionalities of Vim that you might have missed while using conventional text editors. These often-confusing functionalities like block selection will be made easier to understand with illustrative examples to help you learn and become more confident.

We hope that by the end of this chapter, you will have gained an in-depth knowledge of Advanced Visual Modes and Selections in Vim. With this knowledge, you'll be able to edit your text faster and with greater precision than ever before. So, let's dive into the exciting world of Vim's visual modes and unveil the text-editing superpowers you never knew you had!
To provide you with insights into the advanced visual modes and selections in Vim and how to use them, we will provide a sample code below:

```
:vmap <Leader>y :w !grep -o '<C-R>=shellescape(@", 1)<CR>' % \| xargs echo \| xclip -selection c<CR><CR>
```

In this code snippet, we have defined a Vim mapping for visual mode, which assigns the function of copying the selected text into the system clipboard. You can see that the mapping starts with `:vmap` which means that it is for visual mode.

The `<Leader>y` in the snippet represents the new mapping for copying the visually selected text. The `:w` saves the changes, and the `grep -o '<C-R>=shellescape(@", 1)<CR>' % \| xargs echo` represents a command to search for a pattern and copy it to the clipboard using `xclip -selection c`.

In simple terms, the code sets up a shortcut that allows a user to select the text using any of Vim's visual modes and then copy it to the system clipboard for use in other applications. 

This mapping is ideal when you want to use the selected text in some other applications like an email, presentation or somewhere else outside Vim. By incorporating functionality like this into your Vim configuration, you can greatly streamline your workflow and become more productive.

We hope this code snippet helps you understand how the advanced visual modes and selections in Vim can be used to simplify your text editing process.
